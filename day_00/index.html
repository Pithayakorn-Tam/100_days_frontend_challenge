      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, I’m Tam. I lived in Saraburi until I turned 18. I just graduated
        from Grade 12 in March this year. Now, I study at Thammasat University,
        where we learn to love people. I’m in the Faculty of Science, majoring
        in Computer Science. I’ve been studying this major for about five weeks,
        and I’ve already gained a lot of knowledge. Although I didn’t originally
        intend to choose this faculty and major, I don’t regret it. I see it as
        an opportunity to improve my skills more and more.

      <h2>My Dream</h2>
      <p>
        My dream may not sound exciting. It might seem boring compared to other
        people’s dreams. Some dream of becoming the richest person in the world,
        a president, or a scientist. But my dream is simple: “I want to do what
        I truly want to do,” as long as it’s within the law. So, what do I want
        to do? I want to learn about things I’m curious about, play when I feel
        like it, and travel to places I want to visit—without worrying about
        money. It may sound boring, but to me, it’s the perfect life.

      <h2>My Goals</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>I want to learn every computer language.</li>
        <li>I want to exercise regularly and stay healthy.</li>
        <li>I want to save money for unexpected situations in the future.</li>
        <li>
          If possible, I want to keep learning until I become a Doctor—and maybe
