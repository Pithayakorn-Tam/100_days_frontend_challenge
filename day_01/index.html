      <h2>🐰 Introduction to Rabbits</h2>
      <p>
        Rabbits are small mammals belonging to the family Leporidae and the
        order Lagomorpha, which also includes hares and pikas. Known for their
        long ears, fluffy tails, and gentle nature, rabbits have captivated
        humans for centuries—as pets, symbols in folklore, and even as
        ecological influencers. Domesticated rabbits are descendants of the
        European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), which was first bred for food
        and fur. Today, rabbits are beloved companions in homes around the
        world, with over 100 recognized breeds ranging from tiny dwarfs to giant
        Flemish rabbits.

      <h2>🌍 Natural Habitat and Behavior</h2>
      <p>
        Wild rabbits are found across various continents, except Antarctica.
        They typically inhabit meadows, forests, grasslands, and even deserts.
        Their homes—called warrens—are complex networks of underground tunnels
        that provide shelter from predators and harsh weather. Rabbits are
        crepuscular, meaning they are most active during dawn and dusk. Their
        large eyes and ears are evolutionary adaptations that help them detect
        predators in low light. With nearly 360-degree vision and acute hearing,
        rabbits are constantly alert. Their powerful hind legs allow them to
        escape danger with swift, zigzagging hops.

      <h2>🧬 Anatomy and Unique Traits</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Ears: Not just for hearing—rabbit ears help regulate body temperature.
        </li>
        <li>
          Eyes: Positioned on the sides of their head for panoramic vision.
        </li>
        <li>
          Teeth: Continuously growing incisors require constant gnawing to
          prevent overgrowth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Digestive System: Rabbits practice caecotrophy, a process where they
          eat soft fecal pellets to reabsorb nutrients missed during the first
          digestion.

      <h2>🍽️ Diet and Nutrition</h2>
      <p>
        Rabbits are herbivores with a diet centered around fiber. A healthy
        rabbit diet includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>- Hay (80–90%): Essential for digestion and dentalhealth.</li>
        <li>
          - Fresh vegetables (10–15%): Leafy greens like romaine, parsley, and
          cilantro.
        </li>
        <li>Pellets (5–10%): Fortified with vitamins and minerals.</li>
        <li>Fresh water: Always available.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Avoid sugary fruits, iceberg lettuce, and processed human foods. Rabbits
        need constant access to hay to maintain gut motility and prevent dental
        issues.
